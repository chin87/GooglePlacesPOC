Code assignment
Abstract
Create an app which gets data from Goole Places API Web Services and displays on Map. All user
query should be saved and that should come as help when next time user tries to search any places. Help
in search should be AutoComplete. We expect you use REST API. Please do not directly use Google API
client to get the data.
Screen 1 : A search box where user will enter place name. Result should be populated in list below the
search box. User can tap on the search result and move to the next screen which is a Map Screen along
with photos of that places.
Screen 2 : It will display a pin/annotation on map with user's current location on screen. Below the map,
you need to display photos for that places which will be small thumbnail sized images and horizontally
scrollable, again using Google's API. User can download that image. Downloaded image will be stored in
SDCard if available else show error message.
Notes:
1. Submit your code on github or bitbucket repository and share it with us.
2. Put whatever best tools, techniques and approaches you have to deal with the problem.
3. In case of any query please communicate on this email.
4. Following a TDD approach will be bonus.
